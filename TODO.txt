- wiki should have dark theme

- underscores for page names should work, so "row_id" should be a page

- would be nice to have | aliases for pages linked to

- Address this error:

Hi @philipkd,

You recently used a password to access the repository at philipkd/philipkd.com with git using git/2.24.3 (Apple Git-128).

Basic authentication using a password to Git is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Visit https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team

Issues with DokuWiki:

- I'd have to completely re-do the template
- I'd have to install a plugin to get site export
- It's not MarkDown
- I went pretty far after starting up the Machine Learning wiki and then abandoned it, so there must be some high-level issue I had
