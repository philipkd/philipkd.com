<p>If prosperity is determined by population density, then the equators have always won. </p>

<h1>Cyclicality</h1>

<p>The Romans conquered as far North as Britain, and the British colonized as far South and as the Horn of Africa. The North required orderly villages for survival in the harsh weather, thus leading to the Dutch village model that eventually became the Dutch empire. Other empires that adopted their city-planning technology, such as the French, British and even American, profited from it.</p>

<p>There could be a macro-cycle, whereby technologies that favor scale trade dominance with technologies that favor being lightweight, similar to the trading of dominance between major tech companies and startups.</p>

<h1>Opinions</h1>

<p>Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_and_wealth">expert opinions</a> from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Montesqieu:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cold air constringes (sic) the extremities of the external fibres of the body; this increases their elasticity, and favours the return of the blood from the extreme parts to the heart. It contracts those very fibres; consequently it also increases their force. On the contrary, warm air relaxes and lengthens the extremes of the fibres; of course it diminishes their force and elasticity. People are therefore more vigorous in cold climates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Henry Thomas Buckle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jared Diamond:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the far north has not always been the wealthiest latitude; until only a few centuries ago, the wealthiest belt stretched from Southern Europe through the Middle East, northern India and southern China. A dramatic shift in technologies, beginning with ocean-going ships and culminating in the Industrial Revolution, saw the most developed belt move north into northern Europe, China, and the Americas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hernando Zuleta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where output fluctuations are more profound, i.e. areas that experience winter, saving is more pronounced, which leads to the adoption or creation of capital-intensive technologies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Sam Tanzer's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/03/20/why-is-there-such-a-strong-correlation-between-geographic-distance-from-the-equator-and-prosperity/">opinion on Forbes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since just staying warm enough to survive the winter in these climates costs more than the per capita income in some of the world's poorer equatorial countries, I'd expect the correlation to exist almost by definition.</p>

<p>Polar climes have <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2016/08/09/are-people-in-colder-countries-taller/">taller humans</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_rule">Allen's rule</a> dictates that colder climes would have creatures with smaller surface-area-to-volume ratios, i.e. shorter legs, though.</p>
