<p>Dimensions for n-dimensional arrays are not the same as dimensions in real space. In Numpy:</p>

<ul>
<li>A shape with n-comma-separated axes has a dimension of n</li>
<li>the last axis is lowest-level feature</li>
</ul>

<p><em>example 1:</em></p>

<p>M has a shape(4, 3) to represent a list of four "3D points". It has 2 dimensions, and can be described as "4 rows, 3 columns" or "4 by 3." A point in M-space would be something like (1,2), representing the 2nd "point", and its "coordinate on the z-axis."</p>

<p><em>example 2:</em></p>

<p>M has a shape(8,1024,512) to represent 8 images, with 1024 pixels, with 512 color probabilities (from 9 bit space). It has 3 dimensions, and can be described as "8 by 1024 by 512". A point in M-space like (1,2,3) would represent the "2nd image, the 3rd pixel, and the probability estimate for each of the 512 colors."</p>
