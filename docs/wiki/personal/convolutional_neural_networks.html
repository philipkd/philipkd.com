<p>Accuracy on MNIST: 99%</p>

<p>CNNs are the most popular example of <strong>deep learning</strong>. What separates deep learning from ordinary machine learning is the innovation of having multiple layers. Multiple layers enable greater model complexity. Each layer creates further abstractions that build to a hierarchical feature representation.</p>

<h1>High-Level Concepts</h1>

<h2>Convolution</h2>

<p><img src="multiplied-function-integral.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>conv(<em>f</em>,<em>g</em>) = area(<em>t</em>) where <em>t</em> is the shift of <em>g</em></p>

<h1>Layers</h1>

<h2>kernel/filter, K, feature detector</h2>

<p><img src="convolved-feature.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>"The first ConvLayer is responsible for capturing the Low-Level features such as edges, color, gradient orientation" etc."<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53">*</a></p>

<p><strong>stride</strong> is how far across and down the filter moves. The default is (1,1)</p>

<p><strong>padding</strong> determines whether to artificially expand the image, usually by mirroring the edge pixels, so that the filter starts centered on (0,0) rather than (w/2,w/2). <em>valid padding</em> which drops pixels where filter doesn't fit.</p>

<h2>Pooling</h2>

<p><img src="pooling.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>max pooling</strong> takes the maximum value of the 9 squares
<strong>average pooling</strong> takes the average value of the 9 squares</p>

<h2>Fully Connected (<a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/dense-vs-convolutional-vs-fully-connected-layers/191">a.k.a.</a> Dense) Layer</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense">dense layer</a>, without any modifications, is simply the <em>M</em> in <em>y = Mx + b</em>. The last dimension of <em>M</em> is whatever you want the last dimension of <em>y</em> to be, also called "units." the 1st dimension of the output (<em>y</em>) is the first dimension of (<em>x</em>). If the rank (number of dimensions) of the input is greater than 2, then the shape of <em>y</em> is the input's first n-1 dimensions, and the nth dimension is the units.</p>

<p>A stack of pure dense layers is redundant, since they can be represented by one dense layer. In deep learning, for multiple dense layers to be meaningful, there have to be other non-linear interactions, either between the layers themselves, or more commonly, with non-linear activation functions on the dense layers.</p>

<p>Two FCs are used in CNNs for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47007658/idea-behind-how-many-fully-connected-layers-should-be-use-in-a-general-cnn-netwo">optimization reasons</a>.</p>

<p><img src="cnn-overview.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Note: convolution is more expensive than matrix math, which is part of why FCs are designed this way</em></p>

<h1>CNN-specific Techniques</h1>

<p>When you <strong>mixup</strong>, you add more samples that are mixes of two samples, like a cat overlaid with a dog at 50% alpha, and the label being (0.5,0.5). This process helps prevent overfitting by essentially making the model more of a probabilistic thinker.</p>

<p><strong>TTA</strong> (test-time augmentation) augments the test dataset with flips, etc. It then predicts on those augs and ensembles them.</p>

<p><strong>sub-sampling</strong> scales an image by removing every other row/column.</p>
