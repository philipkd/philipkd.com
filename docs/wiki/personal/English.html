<h1>Apostrophes</h1>

<p>Gates's vs. Gates' is a matter of taste.</p>

<h1>Irregular verbs</h1>

<h2>"Good" vs. "well"</h2>

<p>"Good" is an adjective. "Well" is a verb. Think: "you fight good" vs. "you fight well." Informal usages of good and well are as adverbs</p>

<p>"I'm good" works because it's an adjective. "I'm well" is fine if you're referring to health.</p>

<h2>"Lie" vs. "lay"</h2>

<p>As a verb, "lie" means "to be in or assume a horizontal position." "Lay" is a verb with a direct object.</p>

<h1>Initials</h1>

<p>"J.K. Rowling" keeps the first name on the same line, due to <a href="https://apvschicago.com/2011/03/initials.html">word-wrapping on the web</a>.</p>

<h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>The cut-off for spelled numbers is a matter of taste (nine or lower, ten or lower, etc.). But stay consistent with all subsequent ones if they're the same units.</p>

<h1>Parentheses</h1>

<p>Complete sentences get periods inside. Parenthetical expressions ending a sentence get periods outside.</p>

<h1>Pronunciation</h1>

<p>The built-in Mac and Kindle dictionaries use Oxford's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_respelling_for_English#Traditional_respelling_systems">traditional respelling</a>, which is likely COD (Concise Oxford English Dictionary).</p>

<p>IPA is composed of modified Latin/Greek alphabets. The Latin consonants correspond to French and most European languages. The Latin vowels correspond to Spanish.</p>

<h1>Quotation marks</h1>

<h2>The placement of other punctuations</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Commas and periods always go inside the quotation marks in American English; dashes, colons, and semicolons almost always go outside the quotation marks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/quotation-marks/">source</a></p>

<p>Even in a long <a href="https://getitwriteonline.com/articles/punctuating-with-quotation-marks/">list of quoted items</a>.</p>

<p>Exclamation and question marks go based on whether the quoted passage is the question/exclamation.</p>

<h2>Quoting <a href="https://style.mla.org/direct-question-in-a-sentence/">thoughts</a>:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re writing fiction, you may style a character’s thoughts in italics or quotation marks. Using italics has the advantage of distinguishing thoughts from speech.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Her footsteps echoing across the poorly lit, deserted alley, Julie thought to herself, Mother will be furious if she finds out I walked home instead of calling for a ride. Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. “Julie! Why didn’t you wait for me?” In the darkness, Kayla, her cross-country teammate, came into focus. She had completely forgotten that Kayla had asked to walk home together.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, when quoting a source, use quotation marks, and provide an indicator like, "she thought to herself."</p>

<h2>Quoting <a href="https://style.mla.org/direct-question-in-a-sentence/">direct questions</a>:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a direct question contained in a sentence is long or has internal punctuation, set the question off with a comma and begin it with a capital letter:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The question posed to the MLA editors was, How should a question contained in a sentence be punctuated? </p>
    
    <p>The teacher wondered, Will my students ever understand how to incorporate a question in a sentence, or will they always do it incorrectly?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>A single question contained in a sentence can also be preceded by a colon as long as the word before the question is not a verb. The question should start with a capital letter:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The answer left us with another question: When can a question be preceded by a colon?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Use lowercase letters to begin questions incorporated in series in a sentence:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Should I punctuate a question contained in a sentence with a comma? with a colon? with a dash?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>In the example above, the questions in series are not capitalized because they are not complete sentences and do not begin with a proper noun.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>But questions in series that are complete sentences are usually more appropriately styled with an initial capital letter:</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>I have several questions: What punctuation should I use? In what circumstances should I use it? What are the rules?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Indirect quotations</h2>

<p>Please say yes.</p>

<p>I told him <a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/direct-and-indirect-quotations">no, he couldn't have a cookie</a>.</p>
