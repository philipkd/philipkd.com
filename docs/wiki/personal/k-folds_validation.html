<p>Process:</p>

<ol>
<li>split samples randomly into <em>k</em>-buckets</li>
<li>select one fold as a hold out (validation set), use the rest as a training set</li>
<li>run for <em>n</em> epochs and save your model</li>
<li>re-run with the other folds from scratch and save those models (key point: if you don't start from scratch, then you'll completely fit the training set)</li>
<li>compare those models</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>stratified k-folds</strong> is the same thing, but in such a way that it preserves a representative sample from a certain class</p>

<p><strong>out-of-fold predictions</strong> are predictions collected from each of the folds' validation phases. You should have one prediction for each sample, but from when they were in temporarily held out</p>
