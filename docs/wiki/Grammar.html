<p>If a <a href="https://style.mla.org/direct-question-in-a-sentence/">direct question contained in a sentence</a> is long or has internal punctuation, set the question off with a comma and begin it with a capital letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question posed to the MLA editors was, How should a question contained in a sentence be punctuated?</p>
  
  <p>The teacher wondered, Will my students ever understand how to incorporate a question in a sentence, or will they always do it incorrectly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But questions in series that are complete sentences are usually more appropriately styled with an initial capital letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have several questions: What punctuation should I use? In what circumstances should I use it? What are the rules?</p>
</blockquote>
