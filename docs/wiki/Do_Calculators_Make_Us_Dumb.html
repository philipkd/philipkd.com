<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-the-dependent-use-of-a-calculator-make-us-stupid/answer/Andrew-Ballinger">Andrew Ballinger on Quora</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it takes less time to use a calculator then it makes you smarter. If it takes you more time (and for simple arithmetic it often will) it makes you dumber.</p>
  
  <p>If someone asks a group of people hard arithmetic problems, the ones without calculators are going to take longer and get wrong answers, sounds pretty dumb to me.</p>
  
  <p>If someone asks a group of people easy arithmetic problems, the ones that have to get out their calculators and type are going to be the slow, dumb ones.</p>
  
  <p>The really dumb thing is not knowing when to use a calculator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a functional definition of being smart or proficient. Calculator-use becomes more favored that mental-times-tables. Likewise, the ability to manipulate interfaces becomes more favored, and alas it's computer programmers today who are rewarded with high salaries, not the math whiz in high school.</p>
