# Wiki

- title's say "." instead of being blank, on public html.

- underscores for page names should work, so "row_id" should be a page

- would be nice to have | aliases for pages linked to

- LateX

Issues with DokuWiki:

- I'd have to completely re-do the template
- I'd have to install a plugin to get site export
- It's not MarkDown
- I went pretty far after starting up the Machine Learning wiki and then abandoned it, so there must be some high-level issue I had
