- wiki should have dark theme

- underscores for page names should work, so "row_id" should be a page

- home pages for sub-wikis should have an appropriate header, like "Riid Wiki"

- the linkages between the personal wiki.php and the poly-wikis things should maybe be clarified

- would be nice to have | aliases for pages linked to

- maybe re-investigate the pre-built wiki softwares

Issues with DokuWiki:

- I'd have to completely re-do the template
- I'd have to install a plugin to get site export
- It's not MarkDown
- I went pretty far after starting up the Machine Learning wiki and then abandoned it, so there must be some high-level issue I had
